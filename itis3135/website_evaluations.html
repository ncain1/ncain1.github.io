                    <h3>The Good Website: <a href=https://www.fullyraw.com/>fullyraw.com</a></h3>
                        <p id="text-block" class="webdesc">Fully Raw is a website for a company selling
                            vegan wellness smoothies and juices. It has a strong 
                            foundation of all the CRAP principles. The website pops
                            out and is easy to read and navigate and is easy on the eyes.
                        </p>
                            <ul id="list_margins" class="eval_list">
                                <li>Contrast: The website adheres easily to the Contrast
                                    principle. The words pop off its vibrant picture and 
                                    rest of the webpage utilizes pictures of products and 
                                    words to pop off of a white background making all info
                                    easily readable.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Repetiton: It follows the CRAP of Repetiton as it repeats
                                    the basic model of the website excluding the top opening page 
                                    which it utilizes to keep the viewer interested. Following that 
                                    it is sectional pictures showing products and info on them which
                                    sticks to the pricniple.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Alignment: It follows the CRAP aspect of Alignment as the 
                                    website is neatly sorted into two rows of products and accompanying
                                    imagery to draw attention and provide information. It sticks to the
                                    established format all the way down and is neatly positioned with 
                                    clever margins and padding. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Proximity: The website adheres to the CRAP principle of Proximity
                                    as everything is neatly spaced out and sectioned by the type of
                                    information provided. Products are grouped along side products and 
                                    dates and locations are neatly grouped as well allowing the viewer to
                                    cleanly digest and navigate the website information.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                </section>

                    <h3>The Bad Website: <a href=https://charlotte.craigslist.org/>craigslist.com</a></h3>
                    <p id="text-block1" class="webdesc">Craigslist is a website designed for local
                        communities to list jobs, services, products, and etc that they would like to 
                        fill or sell. It is an extremely popular site and almost a household name at this 
                        point which makes it so suprising how much of a dumpster fire the website is build wise.
                    </p>
                        <ul class="eval_list">
                            <li>Contrast: The contrast on the webpage is absolutely
                                atrocious as it is just blue hyperlinks littered
                                all over a blank white canvas. Nothing pops out at 
                                you and it isn't easy for your eyes to discern what 
                                is what as it feels like you are doing a word search.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Repetiton: The Repetiton of this webpage while slightly
                                better is still not indicitive of the CRAP principle. They
                                semi-repeat the same slop of lists over and over but not 
                                in a linear format at all. It is as if they slapped the lists 
                                onto the webpage like letter magnet to a refridgerator. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Alignment: As eluded to above nothing is properly aligned at all,
                                they clearly just put anything where there was space in order to 
                                fill up the screen. It is just a blob of mundane text hyperlinks on 
                                a white page that weren't even bothered to be placed in a neat manner.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Proximity: As you can clearly see by one click of this webpage
                                there is not a lick of care towards the proximity aspect as everything
                                is bunched up all over the page. Couple the horrible organization with 
                                poor contrast and you have a huge mess to sort through when attempting
                                to find a certain thing within the constraints of this webpage.
                            </li>
