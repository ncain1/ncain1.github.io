            <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
            <p>There is two main things on the website which will require some JS Functionality.
                Those being the photo gallery on the recent projects and events page where you can 
                flip through the images of the recently hosted events. This will show how successful the events
                were and hopefully attract newcomers in the future. An embedded google 
                maps link on the location and overview page will be implemented to help people better locate 
                the department. Many websites like Amazon and Walmart use gallery slides to show off various things. 
                As far as the embedded map it usually has to do with single building businesses and departments
                to help them to be located by newcomers.
