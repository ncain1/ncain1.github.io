                         Many rockhounders prospect for the thrill of

                        Our personal favorite that we have got our hands on is the mineral
                        fulgurite which is natural tubes or crusts of glass formed by the 
                        fusion of silica (quartz) sand or rock from a lightning strike.

                        We begun on our journey 10 years ago in 2014
                        on a with a trip to the Great Smokey Moutains of 
                        North Carolina. We visited many mines that specialized in 
                        different minerals such as rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and
                        gold. This experience would spur a life-long journey in pursuit
                        of rare and beautiful specimens of gemstones and minerals.

                    <p class="box-container">
                        Later on we would eventually expand our search radius and 
                        begin our search in more distant places such as South Carolina,
                        Georgia, and even Arizona! Our 2020 trip to Arizona was particularly 
                        polarizing as it not only exposed us to new gems and minerals but 
                        a whole new landscape entirely as well as different processes on 
                        obtaining these new gems and minerals.

                        people choose to rockhound and in this section we will go over a few 
                        of the most popular options which you are gifted with the luxury of

                        One of the most common starting methods for ameteur rockhounders
                        is to visit a Rock and Gem show which are gatherings of rock and mineral
                        miners and wholesalers looking to sell off their inventory. A second 
                        option is to go out and mine for the minerals yourself in mines that
                        specialize in the specific rock or gem you are seeking out. Many people
                        love to visit gold mines and pan for gold using gold panning kits and sluces
                        or visit Amethyst mines and dig them from the dirt in predug mining pits.
                        And lastly a lot of rockhounds accumulate a significant amount of their
                        collection in online auctions and bids for gems in minerals through websites.
                        No matter your preferred method you should definitely dive into rockhounding today!
